# Fruit separator
> A simple project will help to find the image contains a fruit or not.

This is a startup repo. This project was created to help the students to get the idea how to use the javascript(brain js library) for image processing.

Overall architecture idea is to create a user interface that helps the users to upload a image that contains a fruit.
The code should figure out by itself that the fruit is ripe or not.

Stratergy.
1. Convert the pixel values into a array of objects.`[{r,g,b}]`
2. Load the data to the brain js and train it.
